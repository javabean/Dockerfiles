What? (purpose)
===============

Adobe AEM 6 server (ex CQ / Communiqu√©) (Java part, no dispatcher)

Running user is `aem6:aem6` (uid: 4502 guid: 4502)

How? (usage)
============

	docker-compose [up -d|stop|start] aem

Starts a CQ / AEM instance with the following properties:

* env vars passed-in via Docker, or declared in file /usr/local/etc/aem6
* cq / aem jar is copied at build-time in `/opt/aem6/aem-*.jar` or `/opt/aem6/cq-*.jar` (see `AEM_JAR_URL`)
* cq / aem install directory is `${CQ_BASEFOLDER:-/srv/aem6}`
* cq / aem licence file is `${CQ_BASEFOLDER:-/srv/aem6}/license.properties`
* cq / aem packages (SP / CFP / hotfixes / featurepacks / ...) to install at startup in `${PACKAGES_ROOT:-/opt/aem6/packages}`

Packages will be installed 1 by 1 at startup (via HTTP API) in lexical order, and will be deleted when installed.  
To restart the AEM instance, simply input an empty file.

Bonus: can also remove Geometrixx if `${REMOVE_GEOMETRIXX}` is set
